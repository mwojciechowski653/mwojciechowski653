## 👋 Hi, I’m Marcin Wojciechowski

I’m a Computer Science student, currently with **BSc in Computer Science (practical profile)** with a strong interest in **databases, backend development, and data analysis**. My projects span from **relational (PostgreSQL)** and **non-relational (MongoDB, Neo4j)** databases, to **cryptography**, **statistical modeling**, and **machine learning**. I enjoy designing data-driven applications, building APIs, and exploring how theory connects with practical solutions.
